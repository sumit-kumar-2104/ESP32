    First-order IIR Butterworth low-pass filter
    
    Optimized for real-time processing on MicroPython.
    Uses pre-calculated coefficients for efficiency.
    
    The filter removes high-frequency noise while preserving the motion
    signal (typically 0.5-10 Hz for human movement).
    
    This helps reduce false positives caused by RF interference,
    especially when auto-calibration selects subcarriers that are more susceptible to noise.

class HampelFilter:
    """
    Hampel filter for outlier detection and removal
    
    The Hampel filter identifies and replaces outliers based on the 
    Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method. It's particularly effective
    for removing spikes and outliers while preserving the signal's 
    characteristics without introducing lag.
    
    How it works:
    1. Maintains a sliding window of recent values
    2. Calculates the median of the window
    3. Calculates MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)
    4. If current value deviates more than threshold*MAD, replace with median
    
    This implementation uses:
    - Pre-allocated buffers (no dynamic list creation per call)
    - Circular buffer for main storage
    - Insertion sort (faster than Timsort for small N)
    
    This is ideal for filtering turbulence values before MVS calculation
    as it removes outliers that cause false positives without smoothing
    the signal (which would reduce sensitivity).
