## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 (recommended)
- ESP32 device (S3/C6 recommended)
- Home Assistant (optional, for testing ESPHome integration)

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/francescopace/espectre.git
cd espectre

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r micro-espectre/requirements.txt
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# C++ tests (ESPHome component)
cd test && pio test

# Python tests (Micro-ESPectre)
cd micro-espectre && pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage (run from micro-espectre/)
cd micro-espectre && pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Code Contributions

### Branching Model

ESPectre uses a simple branching model:

- **`develop`**: Active development branch. All PRs should target this branch.
- **`main`**: Stable release branch. Merges from `develop` when releasing.

### Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make changes** with tests and documentation
5. **Run tests** to ensure nothing is broken
6. **Commit** with clear messages (see [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines))
7. **Push** to your fork
8. **Open a Pull Request** to the `develop` branch

### Commit Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body with more details>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional change)
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat: add low-pass filter for noise reduction
fix: correct calibration for edge cases
docs: update TUNING.md with filter examples
test: add unit tests for Hampel filter
```

### DCO Sign-off (required)

This repository enforces the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) in CI.
Every commit in a pull request must include a valid `Signed-off-by` trailer.

Use:

```bash
git commit -s -m "type: short description"
```

For existing commits, add the sign-off and force-push your branch:

```bash
git commit --amend -s
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Code Style

#### C++ (ESPHome Component)

- Follow ESPHome component conventions
- Use ESP-IDF framework (not Arduino)
- Use `ESP_LOGD`, `ESP_LOGI`, `ESP_LOGW`, `ESP_LOGE` for logging
- All code and comments in English

**File Header:**
```cpp
/*
 * ESPectre - [Component Name]
 * 
 * [Brief description]
 * 
 * Author: [your name] <[your email]>
 * License: GPLv3
 */
```

#### Python (Micro-ESPectre)

- MicroPython compatible (no asyncio, limited stdlib)
- Memory-efficient (ESP32 constraints)
- Use `config.py` for constants
- All code and comments in English

**File Header:**
```python
"""
Micro-ESPectre - [Module Name]

[Brief description]

Author: [your name] <[your email]>
License: GPLv3
"""
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Target branch**: Always `develop` (not `main`)
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Description**: Explain what and why
- **Tests**: Include tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs
- **Single focus**: One feature/fix per PR

### Quality Standards

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| Test coverage | >80% for core modules |
| CI passing | All checks must pass |
| Documentation | Features require docs |
| Code review | At least one approval |

## Data Contributions

Help build a diverse CSI dataset for ML training! Your contributions will improve gesture recognition and HAR models for everyone.

### How to Contribute Data

1. **Collect data** following [ML_DATA_COLLECTION.md](micro-espectre/ML_DATA_COLLECTION.md)
2. **Ensure quality**:
   - At least 10 samples per label
   - 30+ seconds per sample
   - Quiet room for baseline recordings
3. **Document your setup**:
   - ESP32 model (S3, C6, etc.)
   - Distance from router
   - Room type (living room, office, etc.)
   - Any notable characteristics
4. **Submit via Pull Request**:
   - Add your data to `micro-espectre/data/<label>/`
   - Include a brief description in the PR

### Priority Gestures

We're particularly looking for these gestures useful for smart home automation:

| Priority | Gesture | Description | Use Case |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| 🔴 High | `swipe_left` / `swipe_right` | Hand swipe in air | Change scene, adjust brightness |
| 🔴 High | `push` / `pull` | Push away / pull toward | Turn on/off, open/close |
| 🔴 High | `circle_cw` / `circle_ccw` | Circular hand motion | Dimmer, thermostat |
| 🟡 Medium | `clap` | Hand clap | Toggle lights |
| 🟡 Medium | `sit_down` / `stand_up` | Sitting/standing | TV mode, energy saving |
| 🟡 Medium | `fall` | Person falling | Elderly safety alert |
| 🟢 Low | `idle` | No movement | Baseline (always needed) |

### Data Privacy

- CSI data is **anonymous** - contains only radio channel characteristics
- No personal information, images, or audio
- You retain ownership of your contributions
- All contributions will be credited
